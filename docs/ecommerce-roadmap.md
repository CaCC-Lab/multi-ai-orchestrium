## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Stripe Integration**: Complex payment flow - allocate buffer time
2. **Performance Requirements**: 1000 concurrent users - early load testing needed
3. **80% Test Coverage**: Requires disciplined TDD approach
4. **Multi-currency**: Exchange rate API reliability - need fallback strategy

### Mitigation Strategies
- Weekly progress reviews
- Early prototype for payment flow
- Performance testing from Week 8
- Continuous integration testing
- Buffer time in critical phases
