# Multi-AI Workflows Loader (P1.1.1 - Modularized)
# Purpose: Load all workflow modules for Multi-AI orchestration system
# Architecture:
#   - workflows-core.sh: Core workflows (full-orchestrate, speed-prototype, enterprise-quality, hybrid-development, consensus-review, chatdev-develop)
#   - workflows-discussion.sh: Discussion workflows (discuss-before, review-after)
#   - workflows-coa.sh: Chain-of-Agents workflow (coa-analyze)
#   - workflows-review.sh: Code review workflows (code-review, coderabbit-review, full-review, dual-review)
#
# Migration: v3.2 â†’ v3.3 (P1.1.1)
#   - Before: 1952 lines monolithic file
#   - After: 4 modular files (~400-500 lines each)
#   - Benefits: Better maintainability, faster load times, clear organization
#
# Dependencies:
#   - lib/multi-ai-core.sh (must be sourced before this file)
#   - lib/multi-ai-ai-interface.sh (must be sourced before this file)
#   - lib/multi-ai-config.sh (must be sourced before this file)
#
# Usage:
#   source scripts/orchestrate/lib/multi-ai-workflows.sh

set -euo pipefail

# Get the directory of this script
WORKFLOWS_LIB_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)"

# Load workflow modules in dependency order
# Note: All modules depend on multi-ai-core.sh, multi-ai-ai-interface.sh, and multi-ai-config.sh
# which should already be sourced by orchestrate-multi-ai.sh
