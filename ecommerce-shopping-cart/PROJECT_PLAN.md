## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Payment integration delays | High | Medium | Early Stripe API testing, sandbox environment |
| Security vulnerabilities | Critical | Medium | Security audits, penetration testing |
| Performance issues at scale | High | Medium | Load testing, caching strategy |
| AWS costs exceeding budget | High | Low | Cost monitoring, auto-scaling limits |
| Database migration problems | High | Low | Comprehensive backup strategy |

### Technical Risks
- Third-party API downtime (Stripe, SendGrid)
- Database scalability challenges
- Frontend state management complexity
- Browser compatibility issues

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Jest + Supertest (Backend), Jest + RTL (Frontend)
- **Integration Tests:** API endpoint testing, database operations
- **E2E Tests:** Cypress for critical user flows
- **Performance Tests:** Artillery or k6 for load testing
- **Security Tests:** OWASP ZAP, npm audit, Snyk

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint + Prettier for code formatting
- Husky pre-commit hooks
- Code review required for all PRs
- SonarQube or CodeClimate integration
- Branch protection rules

## Performance Requirements

### Target Metrics
- **Page Load Time:** < 2 seconds (desktop), < 3 seconds (mobile)
- **API Response Time:** < 500ms for 95th percentile
